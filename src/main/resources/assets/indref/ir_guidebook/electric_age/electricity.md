# Electricity

Just like pretty much any tech mod, Electricity is a core concept of Industrial Reforged.

> The names Energy and Electricity are both used interchangeably in this mod and its documentation

Energy is measured in Energy Units (EU) and can be generated using various generators.
The first generator you will get access to is
the <ItemImage id="indref:basic_generator" scale="0.6" /> <ItemLink id="indref:basic_generator" />.

## Energy Tiers

This mod has different tiers of Energy which are usually not directly interchangeable. To go from one tier to the next,
one needs to use a [WIP] Transformer.

The standard tiers in the mod are as follows:

- <indref:EnergyTier id="indref:low"/>
- <indref:EnergyTier id="indref:medium"/>
- <indref:EnergyTier id="indref:high"/>
- <indref:EnergyTier id="indref:extreme"/>
- <indref:EnergyTier id="indref:insane"/>
- <indref:EnergyTier id="indref:creative"/>

(Creative Tier is universal and can supply/accept energy from any tier)

(MAX = 2147483647)

## Cables

Since the different Tiers of Energy aren't compatible, each one requires a different kind of cable.
For more information on how these work, visit the dedicated [Cables Page](./cables.md)
