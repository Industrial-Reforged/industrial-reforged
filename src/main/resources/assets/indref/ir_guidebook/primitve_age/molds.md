# Casting Molds

## Clay Molds

Clay Molds are the first mold that can be used for casting.
Since they are only made of clay, they are rather easily destroyed, hence you can only use them once before having to replace them.

Luckily crafting these molds is rather simple.

<Recipe id="indref:clay_mold" />

After obtaining the <ItemImage id="indref:clay_mold" scale="0.6" /> **Blank Molds**, hold them in **your hand**, **sneak** and use your **mouse wheel** to select the correct mold.
After selecting the correct mold, **right-click** while sneaking to change the mold in your hand.

## Steel Molds

After getting access to **Steel** - either through the <ItemImage id="indref:blast_furnace_controller" scale="0.6" /> <ItemLink id="indref:blast_furnace_controller" /> or through **dungeon/village loot** - you are able to retire your fragile clay molds and can switch to the more durable steel molds.

Creating these steel molds works similarly to creating regular clay molds.

Put the item you want a cast for in a [Casting Basin](./casting.md#casting-basin), e.g. <ItemImage id="minecraft:iron_ingot" scale="0.6" /> **Iron Ingots** for a <ItemImage id="indref:steel_mold_ingot" scale="0.6" /> **Steel Ingot Mold**.
Then pour <ItemImage id="indref:molten_steel_bucket" scale="0.6" /> **Molten Steel** over the item. This will fill the basin and output the **Steel Mold** after cooling down.

- Any Ingots -> <ItemImage id="indref:steel_mold_ingot" scale="0.6" /> **Steel Mold Ingot**
- Any Plates -> <ItemImage id="indref:steel_mold_plate" scale="0.6" /> **Steel Mold Plate**
- Any Wires -> <ItemImage id="indref:steel_mold_wire" scale="0.6" /> **Steel Mold Wire**
- Any Rods -> <ItemImage id="indref:steel_mold_rod" scale="0.6" /> **Steel Mold Rod**

Since these **Steel Molds** are unbreakable it is recommended to replace all **Clay Molds** with them.
