## Drain

<ItemImage id="indref:drain" scale="4" />

The drain is a simple block that will drain the block above it, making it useful for collecting infinite amounts of water.
While it does not have a gui, right-clicking it will display the contained fluid and amount.

## Crafting Station

The crafting station is simply a more convenient crafting table that will keep items in the crafting grid.
The block also has a small storage.
