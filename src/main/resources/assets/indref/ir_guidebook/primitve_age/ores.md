# Primitive Ores

## Vanilla Ores

<ItemImage id="minecraft:copper_ore" scale="2" />
<ItemImage id="minecraft:redstone_ore" scale="2" />
</Row>

Iron, Copper and Redstone are some of the most important resources for both primitive and electric components.

## Industrial Reforged Ores

Bauxite, Tin and Lead are the most important ores from this mod during the early and midgame.

Breaking these ores with regular tools or fortune tools will drop raw ores.
Breaking them with silk touch will drop the ores themselves.
Just like vanilla.

(Raw) Ores can be smelted in the regular furnace or the <ItemImage id="indref:ceramic_crucible_controller" scale="0.6" /> [Crucible](./crucible.md) for better yields.

**Bauxite** is used for bricks and **aluminum** production in particular.

**Tin** is an important resource used for <ItemImage id="indref:fluid_cell" scale="0.6" /> <ItemLink id="indref:fluid_cell" /> and cables as well as many other electric and reactor components.

**Lead** is used for <ItemImage id="indref:basic_battery" scale="0.6" /> [Batteries](../electric_age/batteries.md) and the <ItemImage id="indref:hazmat_chestplate" scale="0.6" /> [Hazmat Suit](./tools.md#hazmat-boots)
