Bauxite, Tin and Lead are the most important ores from this mod during the early and midgame.

**Bauxite** is used for bricks and **aluminum** production in particular.

**Tin** is an important resource used for [Fluid Cells](./tools.md#fluid-cells) and cables as well as many other electric and reactor components.

**Lead** is used for [Batteries](../electric_age/batteries.md) and the [Hazmat Suit](./tools.md#hazmat-boots)
