## Rubber Trees

Rubber Trees generate in most biomes like plains, forests, taigas...
Most of the rubber trees you will find will have one or more logs with a resin spot on them.
This spot can be harvested using a <ItemImage id="indref:tree_tap" scale="0.6" /> [Tree Tap](./tools.md#tree-tap) which will give you up to <ItemImage id="indref:sticky_resin" scale="0.6" /> **3 Sticky Resin**.
After a resin spot is depleted, it takes some time till the resin regenerates.
If the log with the resin spot is broken however, it will lose the resin spot and will just be a regular log.

## Rubber

<ItemImage id="indref:sticky_resin" scale="0.6" /> **Sticky Resin** can be smelted to obtain <ItemImage id="indref:rubber" scale="0.6" /> **Rubber** with a 1:1 ratio

<Recipe id="indref:rubber"/>

Once you obtain the <ItemImage id="indref:centrifuge" scale="0.6" /> [Centrifuge](../electric_age/centrifuge.md), <ItemImage id="indref:sticky_resin" scale="0.6" /> **Sticky Resin** can be centrifuged into <ItemImage id="indref:rubber" scale="0.6" /> **3 Rubber** for a more efficient ratio

Rubber will become extremely important later on as it is one of the main ingredients for electrical components and cables.
That's why it is recommended to build a rubber farm early on.
