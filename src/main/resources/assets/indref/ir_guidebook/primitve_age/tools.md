# Primitive Tools

## Tree Tap

<ItemImage id="indref:tree_tap" scale="2" />

The tree tap is the cheapest tool and can be used to harvest <ItemImage id="indref:sticky_resin" scale="0.6" /> [Sticky Resin](./rubber.md) from rubber trees by right-clicking on logs with a resin spot.

## Hammer

<ItemImage id="indref:hammer" scale="2" />

The hammer is used to form multiblocks after they are constructed. This is done by right-clicking the multiblock's controller.

## Wrench

<ItemImage id="indref:wrench" scale="2" />

The wrench can be used to rotate machines and blocks by right-clicking the block.
If a machine is shift-clicked with a wrench, it can be picked up and will save its nbt and data.

## Hazmat Boots

<ItemImage id="indref:hazmat_boots" scale="2" />

The Hazmat Boots are part of the full hazmat set coming soomTM.
They provide complete fall damage resistance, which makes them extremely useful throughout the game, especially when using the <ItemImage id="indref:jetpack" scale="0.6" /> [Jetpack](../electric_age/jetpack.md).

## Fluid Cells

<ItemImage id="indref:fluid_cell" scale="2" />

The fluid cell is a simple fluid container that works like a bucket but can hold more than a 1000 mb.
It is also used in some crafting recipes like <ItemImage id="indref:overclocker_upgrade" scale="0.6" /> [Overclockers](../electric_age/upgrades.md#overclocker).

## Toolbox

<ItemImage id="indref:toolbox" scale="2" />

The toolbox is used to carry around and easily access all of the above tools (except for the hazmat boots and fluid cells).
It can be dyed in a crafting table similar to leather armor.
