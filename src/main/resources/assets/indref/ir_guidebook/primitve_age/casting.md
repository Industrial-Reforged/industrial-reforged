## Casting Basin

In the primitive age, there are two different casting basins.
The blast furnace and the ceramic casting basin.
The difference between them is purely visual.
By right-clicking with <ItemImage id="indref:terracotta_bricks" scale="0.6" /> **Terracotta Bricks** or <ItemImage id="indref:blast_furnace_bricks" scale="0.6" /> **Blast Furnace Bricks** you can switch between the two blocks.

When using a <ItemImage id="indref:blast_furnace_faucet" scale="0.6" /> **Faucet** to cast, the casting basin needs to be placed one block below the faucet.

When casting with a block/multiblock like the <ItemImage id="indref:ceramic_crucible_controller" scale="0.6" /> [Crucible](./crucible.md) that has a built-in faucet, the position is usually at the bottom block below the built-in faucet.
