# Industrial Reforged

Welcome to **Industrial Reforged** — a tech mod inspired by a decade of modding, with a nostalgic vibe throughout.

## Introduction

Industrial Reforged is heavily inspired by mods like Industrial Craft, Greg Tech and HBM's NTM.
The mod is built around progressive automation of processes and resources.
While this is a core design principle, the mod also gives you plenty of freedom in how you approach it.

So be creative when automating — and don't forget to share your factories on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wguJZgvnc2)!

## Overview

Industrial Reforged's progression sits somewhere between Greg Tech's and Industrial Craft's progression.
Progression consists of multiple ages which are typically made up of multiple tiers of electricity

- [Primitve Age](primitive_age.md)

- [Electric Age](./electric_age.md)

- <Color id="gray"> Nuclear Age [WIP] </Color>
